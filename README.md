# Das *Zweiten* Blinkenlichten?
Version 2.0, now with features! Like interactivity, extensibility, and probably some more -ilities as well.

## How is this different to the first one?
Well, apart from simply blinking and confusing people, this version will include support for a hardware button, sound sensor, and other improvements which may or may not make the final cut. It's a cut-and-run from the first version, which like most V1.0s, was dashed together in a rush to Get Something Working Now. This one will have a bit more robustness to it.

# What's this "blinkenlichten" idea?
