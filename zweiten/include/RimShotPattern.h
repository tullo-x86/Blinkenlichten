// Mics are equidistant -- placed at 120째 increments, forming an equilateral triangle
// packed in a circle (the drum skin).
// + Conclusion 1: If all three mics spike at the same time, strike was at the drum centre

// NB: ALL of these are approximate since the speed of sound varies with air temperature
//     -- see http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-speedsound.htm for details.
//     (and there's probably plenty of other considerations like the resonance of the
//     drum skin as well)
// The drum skin is 8.5" diameter ~~= 21cm
// Circumference ~~= 66cm
// Distance from mic to mic ~~= 18cm (18.187)
// Speed of sound = 343m/s == 34,300 cm/s
// 18 / 34300 == 524.78usec (@20째C) -- 515usec @30째C -- 533usec @10째C

// + Conclusion 2: If no other mic spikes within 525usec, strike is on top of first mic
